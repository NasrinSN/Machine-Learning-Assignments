# Overview

This project provides an example of training a basic 1-dimensional classification model to distinguish between two classes. The notebook (`homework_1d_classifier.ipynb`) walks through the process of generating simulated data, defining the model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

# Dependencies

To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- **Python**: 3.12
- **numpy**: 1.26.3
- **matplotlib**: 3.8.2
- **ipykernel**: 6.29.0

# Usage

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can install all necessary dependencies with Python Poetry using the following command:

```bash
poetry init -q
poetry add numpy matplotlib ipykernel
```

If you do not use Visual Studio Code, you can use JupyterLab. Prepare the project directory and launch JupyterLab this way:

```bash
poetry init -q
poetry add numpy matplotlib jupyterlab
poetry run jupyter lab
```

# Additional Notes

- The notebook provides detailed explanations of the code and concepts used throughout the project.
- It demonstrates how to visualize the data, define a simple classification model, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
- The project aims to provide a clear understanding of 1-dimensional classification and the process of building and evaluating a basic model.
